        <h1>Outline!</h1>
        <h3>Things to think about</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Dive right in and start making stuff! Think of it as lego's. Grab bits and pieces of code and put them together to make something different and bigger.</li>
        <li>debug as I go along. It teachers me a lot. And don't forget debugging is part of the process, not something that gets in the way</li>
        <li>toggle between jumping right in and learning based on articles and videos. While jumping right in to a project works, there will be times I need to learn some subjects more in depth. I ultimately want to be understanding what I am doing, not just copying and pasting</li>
       	<li>ask others: those who play board games. What features do they need?</li>
        	<li>Kind of like process work at work
        		<li>What parts of board games are *similar* acorss the board? Die rolls? passing questions? score keeping? moving pieces? passing character sheets?</li>
        	    <li>What features can I automate?</li>
        	    <li>Start general and move more specific</li>

        	</li>
        	<li>Start by *not* looking at other simiar apps. Get the ball rolling with a general idea. The idea is my original idea based on problems and needs I encoutered while playing board games.</li>
        	<li>After I have an idea down,and have made progress, look at other similar apps. There are tons of ideas out there, most of which are goint be better than mine. Incoporate these ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> features </h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Rolling? What kind of optinos for rolling? how do I send to other places? </li>
        <li>Send cards. Send messages</li>
        <li>keep score</li>
        <li>character sheets</li>
        <li>character/piece movement acroess a board</li>
        <li>assign player attributes. What color is a player? Name? etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
